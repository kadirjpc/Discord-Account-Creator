# Discord-Account-Creator
This program uses the random_email() function to generate a random email address, and the random_password() function to generate a random password. It then sends a POST request to the Discord API with the randomly generated email address and password, and saves the email, password, and token to a text file named tokens.txt.

Please keep in mind that the use of this program may be against Discord's terms of service, and may result in account bans or other legal consequences. Use it at your own risk.
